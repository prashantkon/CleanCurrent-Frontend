                            <p class = "text">Plastic pollution is a growing problem in the world's oceans, with a significant amount of plastic waste ending up in landfills and harming marine life. Microplastics in seafood can also affect humans, and coastal communities that rely on the ocean are also impacted. Effective waste management and recycling practices are needed to address the issue and reduce the impact of plastic pollution on the environment and human life.</p>

Many countries have implemented various measures such as plastic bag bans, plastic taxes, and improved waste management systems to reduce plastic pollution. Additionally, there has been a growing awareness, participation, and initiative to develop eco-friendly alternatives to plastics, such as biodegradable options.</p>
